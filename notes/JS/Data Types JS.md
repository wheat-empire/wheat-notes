- There are 8 data-types
	- Number
	- BigInt
	- String
	- Boolean
	- "null"
	- "undefined"
	- Object
	- Symbol
- Number is integers and floats. All in the same
- BigInt is for very big numbers.
- String is for text
- Boolean is true or false
- null is intentional
- undefined is not. Oops. NaN is the same for numbers
- Objects and something, and so is symbol.
