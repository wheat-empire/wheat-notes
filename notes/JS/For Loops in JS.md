- For loops are the better loop
- In JS, they are a bit harder

```js
/* 
beginningCommand is what the for-loop executes when it starts. For example, if it was i=0, then it would run that when the loop starts.
condition is the same as always. It can be like i < 10
stepCommand is what the loop executes when it starts a new iteration. It can be like ++i. This would make i increase everytime alert is said.
*/
for(beginningCommand; condition; stepCommand) {
	alert("Yes");
}
```
