- While loops go on forever as long as condition is met

```js
// This while loop will continue to alert "Yes" as long as the condition is met
while(condition) {
	alert("Yes");
}

// This is a different way of writing it:
do {
	alert("Yes");
} while(condition);
```

- While loops can be iffy, you should be using [[For Loops in JS]]
