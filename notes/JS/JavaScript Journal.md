	- I think the transpilations will be interesting - C
- Don't use callouts and code blocks in lists please - C
- This is how you put [[JS in HTML]].

- The alert mentioned earlier is a [[Modal Types]]. We probably shouldn't use it to tell the people stuff 'cause it's intrusive but it's good for debugging and learning. - C
- `` ` ``  is the better `"` and `'`. It allows you to use `${var1}` syntax, and that's epic.

```js
let userName = prompt("What's your name?", "John");

// Using "" and '' is dumb and redudant because we have you use dumb and long syntax
alert("Your name is " + userName);

// Using `` is cool and epic because you can use ${var1} syntax 'cause it's cool and epic.
alert(`Your name is ${userName}`);
```

- Change things into strings using `String()`, into numbers using `Number()`, and into booleans using `Boolean()`. It doesn't produce errors, just NaN's and undefined's.
- Make constants that are pre-defined uppy-case please. e.g.

```js
// This constant is predefined. Hence, uppy-case
const AGE = 20;

// This constant is not predefined. We don't know it before running. Use mini-case.
const yourAge = prompt("What's your age?", 0);
```

- Finally got through https://javascript.info/ fundamentals. It took a while for sure.
	- Still got to write the notes though :-(
- Instead of [[If Equations in JS]], you could also do [[Oneline If JS]]
	- Also can do [[Switch Syntax]]
- You also use [[Loop Labels]] for high-level `break`
- Also, the very useful [[Function]]
	- It's pretty long - C
